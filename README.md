  OverVue 
</h1>

<p align="center"><b>Prototyping Tool for Vue Developers</b></p>

<p>OverVue is a prototyping tool that allows developers to dynamically create and visualize a Vue application, implementing a real-time intuitive tree display of component hierarchy and a live-generated code preview. The resulting boilerplate can be exported as a template for further development.</p>

<p>这个程序能帮你生成Vue 组件, 设置 routes , 也可以帮你显像Component Parent-Child组件树。你只要做一些小配置然后可以下载code boilerplate. 这样你就可以很方便简洁地生成Vue前台APP了！</p>

## How to use
+ Opening the application will create by default a root App component and a root route called "HomeView"
+ Upload a mockup from your filesystem if you'd like. Remove the mockup and choose a new one if needed.
![](./src/assets/readme/upload_one_mockup.gif)

+ To add a new component, type its name in the component name box and select any HTML elements that should be rendered by that component.
+ HTML elements can also be added after creation by selecting the component in the display, then selecting HTML elements.
+ Select a parent component for the new component if needed.
+ After adding, you can move and resize the component in the display.
![alt text](./src/assets/readme/create_resize_move.gif)

+ You can also add children to components by right-clicking the component to add children to, and you can see the tree re-render as you create new components or change the hierarchy.
![](./src/assets/readme/right_click_add_children.gif)

+ The dashboard shows info about each component (code snippets and HTML elements). Click a component in the display to see its properties.                                               
![](./src/assets/readme/dashboard.gif)

+ You can add new routes and view all components and routes in the sidebar.
![](./src/assets/readme/add_new_route.gif)

+ When finished creating, you can export to a file location of your choice. Below is the exported file structure:

```
public/
  index.html
src/
  assets/
  components/
    UserCreatedComponent1.vue
    UserCreatedComponent2.vue
    ...
  views/
    HomeView.vue
    UserCreatedRouteComponent1.vue
    UserCreatedRouteComponent2.vue
    ...
  App.vue
  main.js
  router.js
babel.config.js
package.json
```

### OverVue v2.0 How to
+ Undo/Redo feature has been added to the top right of the program, you can also use CTRL+z and CTRL+y respectively.

![](./src/assets/readme/undo_redo.gif)

+ You can nest html elements in two different ways:
    1. Upon creating a component and adding an html element into it, Select the component to make it the active component.
    Go to the html elements tab and then double click on the html element you wish to be the target for your new elements.
    Once the html element is selected, use the left hand panel and start adding elements like you were adding it to a component.

    2. Similar to above, but instead of double clicking, you can press the down arrow icon on the html element button to enter it.
    From there the view will change to the contents of that particular HTML element.
    You can then add html elements like you would for a component using the left hand side
    
    ![](./src/assets/readme/nesting_html.gif)

+ Setting layers on a component is done by right clicking the desired component on the component display and using the menu option
  All components start on layer 1 by default.
  
![](./src/assets/readme/layers.gif)

### OverVue v3.0 How to 
+ Within the vuex dropdown menu, there are input fields that allow actions, state properties, and data properties to be created, and a multi-select drop-down menu for each that allows these properties to be added to specific components. 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/JucFNDgSDWwoKOpgH9/giphy.gif)
+ Now users have the ability to edit all aspects of a component, from it's name, to Vuex properties. Navigate to the dropdown menu in the top left and select a component to edit its properties.

### Installation

This app was developed using the Quasar framework, so first you will need to install the Quasar cli
```
npm i -g @quasar/cli
```
Install dependencies
```
npm i
```
To open Vuejs devtools (devtools should be open before devmode, otherwise, you can justforce reload electron app in dev mode after opening dev tools)
```
./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools
```
To run electron app in dev mode
```
quasar dev -m electron
```
To build a new .dmg / windows .exe
```
quasar build -m electron
```
### WSL Installation

**The ability to load the application and/or devtools requires a tool/application to run a linux display as WSL does not have any display drivers since it is based off of just a CLI.
I recommend X410 (https://x410.dev/), althought it does cost $15, for ease of use. There are free options such as VcXsrv(https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) that you can get, but requires more set up.**

If you choose to use x410, you will need to set the environment DISPLAY variable on each console:

So, to open either the Vue devtools or OverVue in dev mode, first start your X Server then enter into the terminal:
For WSL 1 :
```
export DISPLAY=:0
```
For WSL 2 :
```
export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1
```
followed by the command for the devtools or devmode.  If you want both open, enter commands above followed by starting the devtools:
```
./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools
```
Then open a new terminal instance, set the DISPLAY value again (re-enter above command for DISPLAY), and start OverVue in dev mode:
```
quasar dev -m electron
```

### Slack OAuth

For the Slack OAuth, you will need to create a Slack app through their website (https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1), so that you have your own Client Secret and Client ID. Then create two .env files (one for development and one for production).

  1. Create a Slack App from the link above.  Copy your Client ID and Client Secret somewhere safe.
  2. Create two .env files in the main root of this repository.  Name them:
  ```
  .env
  .env.development
  ```
  3. Open .env and add these three environment variables.  Replace <client secret> and <client id> with the client id and client secret given to you when you created your Slack App.
  ```
  SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET = "<client secret>"
  SLACK_CLIENT_ID = "<client id>"
  SLACK_REDIRECT_URI = "overvue://slack"
  ```
  4. Next, open .env.development and do the same, just note that the SLACK_REDIRECT_URI will be different here:
  ```
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET = "<client secret>"
SLACK_CLIENT_ID = "<client id>"
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI = "overvuedev://test"
  ```
